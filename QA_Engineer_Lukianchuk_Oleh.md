I wrote the programs and unit tests in JavaScript using "Jest", and added CI “continuous integration” on GitHub. Added Linter test too. Test cases in the README.md files are also duplicated

QA Engineer Assessment
It is expected to follow the below criteria and steps.
This challenge covers:
- Code challenge using PHP, Java, C# or any other language.
- Test Coverage using Test Cases or Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
- Bug Reporting.

Task 1
Given the below distinct requirements:
1. Create a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the number of values that are a multiplier of either 4 or 6 (or, of course, both).

Task 2
Provide written test scenarios to verify correct implementation in Task 1.

[Test cases multiplier](https://github.com/Oleg-Lukanov/videoslots_multiplier/blob/develop/README.md),

[Tests in the file multiplier.jest.js](https://github.com/Oleg-Lukanov/videoslots_multiplier/blob/develop/src/multiplier.test.js), 

[Test cases palindrome](https://github.com/Oleg-Lukanov/palindrome_tests_ci/blob/develop/README.md),

[Tests in the file palindrome.jest.js](https://github.com/Oleg-Lukanov/palindrome_tests_ci/blob/develop/src/palindrome.test.js)

Task 3
Report 2 Critical bugs you may find on Videoslots and indicate why you feel they are critical.

Deliverables
An accessible online repository including:
1. Executable implementations with details comments to explain it.
2. Written Test Cases or Test Scenarios in BDD format.
3. Detailed written Bug Reports.
4. Anything else that will help you to stand out from the other candidates!
